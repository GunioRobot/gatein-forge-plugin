!!! This is a work in progress, mostly a broken copy of the RichFaces plugin as of now

This plugin allows to add a GateInFacet. It will enable a JSF application to run in a portal environment.

Usage instructions:
From the forge prompt, run the "gatein setup" command to install the GateInFacet.  Installing the GateInFacet installs the required web.xml and portlet.xml

Once the Facet is installed, you are ready to develop your GateIn application.
